Create beautiful buttons, where people can add events and appointments to their calendars. Fast and hustle-free. Highly customizable. As shortcode or via a convenient block.

== Description ==

= Make your events get saved. =

This WordPress plugin lets you create beautiful buttons with calendar links, where people can add events to their calendars.

All of this with just a few clicks and highly customizable, using the popular Add to Calendar Button script (v2.2.9).

Check out the official website for a comprehensive demo and overview: [add-to-calendar-button.com](https://add-to-calendar-button.com).

= üîé WHO THIS IS FOR =
This is for everybody, who wants to include a button at their WordPress site, which enables users to easily add a specific event to their calendars.

Our main goal is to keep this process as easy as possible at maximum compatibility. Simply define your button configuration and everything else is automatically generated by the script.

= üöÄ INTEGRATED IN SECONDS =
You can either use the shortcode [add-to-calendar-button] or the even more convenient Gutenberg Block.

You place the attributes directly in the shortcode, or at the Gutenberg Block settings.

(Mind that you cannot use '[' and ']' characters, when going for the shortcode option! For content formatting, you can use {'{'}*{'}'} instead of [*] there.)

= ‚ú® SUPPORTED CALENDARS =

* Google Calendar.
* Yahoo Calender.
* Microsoft 365, Outlook, and Teams.
* Automatically generated iCal/ics files (for all other calendars, like Apple).

= üìÜ SUPPORTED EVENT TYPES =

* Timed and all-day events.
* One-time, multi-date, recurring.
* Most robust time zone and daylight saving management.
* Dynamic dates (like "today + 3").

= üé® ADJUST THE LOOK =

The button comes with multiple themes as well as a dark and light mode.

You can easily adjust almost every element by setting the respective simple attributes. 
In case you want to go all-in, you can also manipulate all kinds of colors and further styling.

= üññ EXPERT ACCESSIBILITY =

* Optimized and adjustable UX (for desktop and mobile).
* Dynamic dropdown positioning.
* Taking care of all those edge cases, where some scenarios do not support specific setups (like WebView blocking downloads); utilizing beautiful user guidance workarounds.
* Auto-generated Schema.org rich (structured) data for better SEO.
* Full support for mouse, touch, or keyboard input (W3C WAI compliant).
* Aside from the WordPress editor, the button itself supports 20+ languages, incl. RTL text for Arabic; but also offers the option to customize all labels and text blocks.

= üõ†Ô∏è GET STARTED =

After installing and activating the plugin, you can directly start using the button within your pages and blog posts.

= üìÑ ABOUT THE LICENSE =

This plugin is licensed under the GPLv3 license (GNU General Public License 3).

However, mind that the script to actually generate the Add to Calendar Button uses the [Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)!

This usually comes with no restrictions for you, but it forbids you to rework the core script and provide the product (generating an add-to-calendar-button) to others as a managed service.

In almost every case, this will not affect you. If you are not sure, because you are building some kind of SaaS, where you are using the plugin, simply contact us.

== Installation ==

Simply install the plugin via the usual WordPress process - either via the admin panel or by downloading and uploading it.

After the installation, you need to activate the plugin as usual by clicking the respective trigger at your plugins page.

That's it. You can now use it via the shortcode [add-to-calendar-button] or the Gutenberg Block (simply search for it).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =

Yes! You can use it completely free of charge.

The only minor limitation is, that you are not allowed to rework the plugin to somehow sell the generation of the buttons as managed service.

In doubt, simply ask us üôÇ.
